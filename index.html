            <h3>Intro to JD</h3>
            <p>I'm JD!  I live in Fairhope, Alabama.  I'm learning to become a software developer.  Mu purpose for going through Udemy courses and now enrolling and working through Thinkful is different than most. My objectives don't include securing a job at the end of this. My objective is purely to equip myself and our business with a needed skillset for the future.  This is the start of my portfolio page that will be updated with my progress along the way.</p>

            <p>I'll start with the non-business side. I have an amazing wife and 4 kids. My oldest is 8 and my youngest is 3.  It's been a wild last 10 years!  We live on the gulf coast in Fairhope, Alabama and get out an enjoy our surroundings as much as we can.</p>

            <h4>Business and Software Development</h4>
            <p>My objectives are to become proficient in software development. I have a passion for learning this skill as I can clearly see the impact it will have.  The digital experience of our customers has never been more important..and it's that importance is only increasging.</p>
            <p>Through Thinkful, I'm hoping I will come out of this will the ability to create and design web applications.  I hope my skillset will provide my company the needed tools to further streamline internal workflows and produce an experience for our customers that is simple and useful in their day to day lives.</p>
            <p>As our business has grown...so has the complexity.  Having a foundation in software development will also allow me the ability to understand what skills it makes sense to hire out for.  We've tried working with third party developers and it is something we'd prefer to bring totally in house to better align incentives.  The ability to find and work with great programmers is improved with a foundation in development.</p>

            <h4>Project #1</h4>
            <p>I'd like to build a personal website that has a blog with it. I'd love to have a page where I can write about things that really matter to me. Currently, I'm limited to pure business topics as I write for our business.  I'd like to expand the topics and I can only do that through a personal blog.</p>
            <p>I'm not totally sure what the stack would be.  Maybe mongodb and Node?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="">GitHub Repo</a></li>
              <li><a href="">Live App</a></li>
            </ul>

          <div class="item">
            <h4>Project #2</h4>
            <p>I'd like to build an allocation that simplifies our advisors lives. It would provide a one stop shop for them to log in and see the What, Why, and How of their portfolios.It would reduce the lines of communication and provide a persistent database of the solutions we deliver all while providing easy access to the messaging and content we produce on their behalf.</p>

            <h4>Project #3</h4>
            <p>I'd like to build a simple financial security course designed for direct to consumer use.  This tool will start with our advisors and provide an environment and ecosystem for them to onboard new clients, shift focus on the right things, and execute the plan flawlessly.  It will improve utilization of technolgoy and eliminate overhead that's not needed.</p>
